# socket.io

- **WebSocket** is a communication protocol which provides a full-duplex and low-latency channel between the server and the browser.

## Handshake
- At the beginning of the Engine.IO connection, the server sends some information which called handshake.

## Server instance
- often called io
- methods
  - io.socketsJoin()
  - io.socketsLeave()
  - io.disconnectSockets()
  - io.fetchSockets()
  - io.serverSideEmit()
- events
  - io.on('connection', socket => {})

## socket instance (server-side)
- methods
  - socket.id
    - Each new connection is assigned a random 20-characters identifier.
    - the Socket joins the room identified by its own id, which means you can use it for private messaging
  - socket.handshake
    - This object contains some details about the handshake that happens at the beginning of the Socket.IO session.
  - socket.rooms
    - This is a reference to the rooms the Socket is currently in.
  - socket.data
  - socket.conn
- As long as you do not overwrite any existing attribute, you can attach any attribute to the Socket instance and use it later
- middlewares
  - socket.use(([event, ...args], next)) => {}
- event
  - disconnect
  - disconnecting

## middlewares
- A middleware function is a function that gets executed for every incoming connection, and this function will be executed only once per connection
- Handling middleware error
```javascript
socket.on("connect_error", (err) => {
  console.log(err.message); // prints the message associated with the error
});
```

## Sending credentials
- The client can send credentials with the auth option
  - Those credentials can be accessed in the handshake object on the server-side
