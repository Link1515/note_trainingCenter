### document

- retrieving
  - When you load documents from MongoDB using model functions like findOne(), you get a Mongoose document back.
- update using save()
  - You can modify a document using vanilla JavaScript assignments and Mongoose will convert it into MongoDB update operators.
  - Mongoose calls the document's validate() method before saving.
  - Mongoose first casts values to the specified type and then validates them.
  - With save(), you get full validation and middleware.
- updating using querise

  - Note that update(), updateMany(), findOneAndUpdate(), etc. do not execute save() middleware. If you need save middleware and full validation, first query for the document and then save() it.

  > Mongoose casts parameters to query functions like findOne(), updateOne() by default.
  > However, Mongoose does not run validation on query function parameters by default.

### subdocument

- Subdocuments are not saved individually, they are saved whenever their top-level parent document is saved.
- Subdocuments have save and validate middleware just like top-level documents.
  - Calling save() on the parent document triggers the save() middleware for all its subdocuments, and the same for validate() middleware.
  - Subdocuments' pre('save') and pre('validate') middleware execute before the top-level document's pre('save') but after the top-level document's pre('validate') middleware.
    > parentSchema validate => childSchema validate => childSchema svae => parentSchema save
